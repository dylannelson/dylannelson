Hey, I'm Dylan Nelson. I'm fourth year double majoring in **Data Science** and **Cognitive Science** at UCSD 🎓    
## Data Science 📊 
I'm starting to make a collection of all the data science work I'm allowed to publish in my [Data-Sci_SideProjects](https://github.com/dylannelson/Data-Sci_SideProjects) repo
- Just about all of my commits are from Data Science work for school that isn't allowed to be shared publicly, hence why they are all private  
- So far these have mostly been done to help me get better at:
  - messing with a variety of API's  
  - web based tools  
  - Starting to get back into hardware stuff with micro-controllers  
## Personal
Working on a bit of a [blog](https://www.dylan-nelson.com) while I'm learning HTML on the side.  (updates are coming slowly)    
I'm really into getting long exposure shots for views of space 🌌, building robots 🤖, caring for animals 🐶, and more, check it out [here](https://www.dylan-nelson.com/Fun/Space.html)   
Also I have a bus i'm building, a [passion project of mine 🚌](https://dylannelson.github.io/Blog/blog.html)
