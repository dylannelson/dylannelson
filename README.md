Hey, I'm Dylan Nelson. I'm a **Data Science** and **Cognitive Science** graduate from UCSD 🎓    
## Data Science 📊 
I'm starting to make a collection of all the data science work I'm allowed to publish in my [Data-Sci_SideProjects](https://github.com/dylannelson/Data-Sci_SideProjects) repo
- A decent amount of my coding was privately published on work accounts or servers
- So far most of my public work has been done to help me get better at:
  - messing with a variety of API's and data sources    
  - web based tools and site building  
  - A renewed interest in micro-controllers & robotics  
## Personal
Working on a bit of a [blog](https://www.dylan-nelson.com) while I'm learning HTML on the side.  
I'm really into getting long exposure shots for views of space 🌌, building robots 🤖, caring for animals 🐶, and more, check it out [here](https://dylan-nelson.com/joy/)   
Feel free to connect with me if you want to work together, I'm still always learning :)
