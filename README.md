Hey, I'm Dylan Nelson. I'm third year double majoring in **Data Science** and **Cognitive Science** at UCSD ðŸŽ“  
## Data Science ðŸ“Š
I'm starting to make a collection of all the data science work I'm allowed to publish in my [Data-Sci_SideProjects](https://github.com/dylannelson/Data-Sci_SideProjects) repo
- Just about all of my commits are from Data Science work for school that isn't allowed to be shared publically, hence why they are all private  
- So far these have mostly been done to help me get better at:
 - accessing API's
 - understanding data I'm personally interested in
 - getting better at making visualizations 

## Personal
Working on a bit of a blog while I'm learning HTML on the side. Right now it doesn't have much but if you want to see my passion project, the bus I'm working on, check it out [here ðŸšŒ](https://dylannelson.github.io/Blog/blog.html) (updates are coming slowly)  
Also plan to make a collection of my photgraphy on the site, I'm really into getting long exposure shots for views of space ðŸŒŒ
